# Neomom, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

We used a survey method so that we could find trends in people’s grocery shopping and usage habits. The survey would provide us with valuable data on if and how people plan for grocery shopping, how many people they shop for, what kind of food do they buy, and how they store their food and if those methods have proven to be effective so far.

The size of the survey group is n=9.

## Findings

We collected mock data and reproduced some graphs using the mock data.

The followings are what we found:

*Over half of the participants tend to prepare when they go grocery shopping.


![alt text](../assets/q2.png "Question2 img")
*66% of participants responded that 11% to 20% of the food goes bad. Almost all participants tend to leave their food until it goes bad.

*Almost all participants don't care whether groceries are organic or not when buying them.

*Almost all participants are willing to eat expired foods if they didn't go bad.


![alt text](../assets/q5.png "Question5 img")
*Over half of the participants don't use a grocery list.

*66% of participants don't use any recipes when they are cooking.


![alt text](../assets/q8.png "Question8 img")
*Over half of the participants don't know if their refrigerators are set at appropriate temperatures.


![alt text](../assets/q9.png "Question9 img")
*77% of participants expect their groceries to last for 5-7 days. 


![alt text](../assets/q10.png "Question10 img")
*Almost all participants don't want to get a result of our study.


In addition, we found some dairy products, fruits or groceries are often bought and expired. Almost all the responders store their foods in cabinets or fridges. One-third of the participants are following Carnivorous diets.


## Conclusions

From the findings, we recognized many participants waste some of their foods and don’t use a shopping list when they are shopping. We can help these people through our app by sending notifications when they have foods that are close to expiration. To consume almost expired foods, we come up with a shopping list that can make great foods with them. Since they have some enthusiasm to prepare their shopping, they will use our shopping list if they like our suggestions. Almost all participants don’t care whether groceries are organic or not, but we will support an option for that since we respect a small group’s opinion for better shopping. The choice of option will be adopted on our shopping list. 

Almost all responders buy groceries for a small group such as one or two people and they expect their groceries to last for 5-7 days. For efficient consumption and less wasted foods, we will provide an appropriate amount of groceries on our shopping list. Also, we plan to send notifications every 5-7 days. In addition, they can use their own recipes, but we will also recommend other recipes with the same ingredients. By having a variety in their meals, users can increase satisfaction and consume more effectively.

Some of the participants don’t know about the appropriate temperature of their refrigerators and storing their foods suitably. Also, they tend to eat expired foods if they look okay. Our app will support users with some great information about storing their foods efficiently and eating safely.


## Caveats

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, students and the general public have been advised to stay indoors for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester. The implications of this were that human experiments were not allowed nor possible. As a result, we resorted to using mock data since it was the next best thing we had access to.

## Scenarios

### Chad Frattington
Chad has an issue with letting his food expire due to bad storage. He is either storing food in the wrong places or in the right places for too long. He’s looking to make sure all of his food gets eaten before it goes bad

Neomom can help Chad store his food in the right places by utilizing the pantry section of our app. In that section it collects the food you have recently purchased categorized by where each item needs to be stored. This section can also help Chad utilize his groceries before they go bad by sending him push reminders with recommended recipes for the food that he already has.


### Vera Mccarthy
Vera has an issue with having food items she doesn’t know what to do with. She has a love for cooking and just needs to be pointed in the right direction

To help prevent food waste our app can help Vera discover new recipes that use the food she already has in her pantry. All she would have to do is go into the recipes section of the app and filter based off of what is in her pantry. 

### Chuck Trarorein
Chuck cooks the majority of his food before it goes bad, but doesn't get as much enjoyment out of each meal that he cooks. He wants to start cooking more variety than what he grows but wants to keep eating his own produce with every meal.

The statistics tab of the pantry section would best help break Chuck out of problem. In the statistics tab you can read reports of what food you most let go bad. Utilizing this he can start saving less produce for himself and use the extra money he earns to buy other ingredients. He can also use the recipe section and filter by pantry+shopping cart to help introduce new foods into his life

### Danny dogson
Danny is an extreme mom and tries to feed her kids the best food that she can while staying on a budget. Because of it she sometimes forgets when foods expire. She also wants to experiment with ingredients she finds interesting but never knows what to do with them once she buys them.

The panty tab has a modifiable expiration date for each item in it, the original date is based off of an average shelf life but can be changed for discount items that generally have an earlier expiration date. The recipes tab can help Danny find new recipes with the ingredients she wants to use. All she would have to do is filter by ingredient.

### Eric Christof
Eric is only adventurous for love, and because of it he always has ingredients he doesn't know what to do with. He also wants to start trying new food but don't want to try anything too new

Our app would not only help him find recipes for these ingredients he doesn't know what to do with but it can also help him find recipes that help push his taste pallet out. In the recipe tab he can do two different searches. Firstly he can search for recipes with ingredients that he has saved in his pantry so his food doesn't go to waste. He can also search for recipes and filter out recipes that have foods he doesn’t want to eat yet.
