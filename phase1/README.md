# Neomom, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

## Methods

We used a survey method so that we could find trends in people’s grocery shopping and usage habits. The survey would provide us with valuable data on if and how people plan for grocery shopping, how many people they shop for, what kind of food do they buy, and how they store their food and if those methods have proven to be effective so far.

The size of the survey group is n=9.

## Findings

For each method, describe the users you collected data from (demographics and how they represent your user base) and summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you may want to include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

We collected mock data and reproduced some graphs using the mock data.

What we found:

* Over half of the participants tend to prepare when they go to grocery shopping.


![alt text](../assets/q2.png "Question2 img")
* 66% of participants responded that 11% to 20% of their food goes bad. Almost all participants tend to leave that some of their food goes bad.


![alt text](../assets/q3.png "Question3 img")
* When almost all participants buy groceries, they don't care about them whether groceries are organic or not.


![alt text](../assets/q4.png "Question4 img")
* Almost all participants want to eat expired foods if the foods didn't go bad.


![alt text](../assets/q5.png "Question5 img")
* Over half of the participants don't use a grocery list.


![alt text](../assets/q6.png "Question6 img")
* Almost all participants shop for a small group of families.


![alt text](../assets/q7.png "Question7 img")
* 66% of participants don't use any recipes when they cooking.


![alt text](../assets/q8.png "Question8 img")
* Over half of the participants don't know about their refrigerators are set at appropriate temperatures.


![alt text](../assets/q9.png "Question9 img")
* 77% of participants expected their groceries will be used for 5-7 days. 


![alt text](../assets/q10.png "Question10 img")
* Almost all participants don't want to get a result of our study.


In addition, we found some dairy products, fruits, or groceries are usually expired and responders usually buy these items. Almost the responders stores their food on cabinets or fridges.  One-third of the participants are fellowing Carnivorous diets.


## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)


From the findings, we recognize almost all participants waste some of their foods and they don’t use a shopping list when they are shopping. We can help these people through our app since our app provides notifications when they have almost expired foods. To consume almost expired foods, we support a shopping list that can make geat foods with the expired foods. They have some enthusiasm to prepare their shopping, so they can use our shopping list if we provide appropriate items. Almost all participants don’t care whether groceries are organic or not, but we will support an option for that since we respect a small group’s opinion for better shopping. The choice of option will be adopted on our shopping list. 

Almost all responders buy groceries for a small group such as one or two people and they expect their groceries will be expired in 5-7 days. For efficient consuming and less wasted foods, we will provide appropriate amounts of groceries in our shopping list. Also, we plan to send notifications with 5-7 days period. In addition, they are using their own recipes, but we will recommend other recipes with the same ingredients. Through diverse recipes, users can increase satisfaction and more effective consumption. 

Some of the participants don’t know about appropriate temperature of their refrigerators and storing their foods suitably. Also, they tend to want to eat expired foods if the foods look good. Our app will support some great information which is for storing their foods efficiently and safe eating.

## Caveats

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, students and the general public have been advised to stay indoors for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester. The implications of this were that human experiments were not allowed nor possible. As a result, we resorted to using mock data since it was the next best thing we had access to.

Eric is a 30 year old tech startup worker who doesn't really think about what he puts in his body. For most of his meals he eats out or just makes something simple at home.

##### bad habits:
Often will just throw out the ingredients he bought because his date canceled on him. Never really tries anything other than the food that he knows from his childhood.

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do

## Supplementary Materials

Include link(s) or cop(ies) to your instrument(s) itself (questionnaire for a survey, protocol for an interview or contextual inquiry, etc)
