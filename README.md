# Neomom

Grocery list app that will add purchased items into a pantry section with a countdown of how many days it has left if properly stored. The app will say the proper way to store it and give you recipe ideas for food that is about to go bad. It can also tell you not to buy something you always let go bad or buy less of it.

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

* **Research Method:** Google Forms survey shared with the class via the CSCI 431 Slack. The participants were our classmates from the class. Once the data was gathered, Charles collected screenshots of the data in the form of pie and bar graphs.

* According to the results of the survey, while participants don’t really have as big of an issue with food waste as we thought, we did find that lack of preparedness when grocery shopping is an issue our classmates face.

## Phase 2: User-Centered Design

* While our data showed that users’ food doesn’t tend to go bad and that being unprepared was an issue our classmates faced when going grocery shopping, it’s important to keep in mind that our sample size was incredibly small. However, there were still individuals in our survey that dealt with food waste and weren’t sure about how to keep groceries fresh. Our app aims to help users make the best out of their groceries by showing them what will soon go bad and how to cook or prepare those ingredients.

* Our persona and scenario showed us that there can be situations in which being prepared doesn’t solve everything. There may be products not on your **Shopping List** that make it into your cart. We considered this a completely normal occurrence so we thought this could be solved by creating a feature where a user can scan their receipt with their phone’s camera. Anything not on their **Shopping List** would be added to their **Fridge/Freezer/Pantry**.
