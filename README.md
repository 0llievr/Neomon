# Neomom

Grocery list app that will add purchased items into a pantry section with a countdown of how many days it has left if properly stored. The app will say the proper way to store it and give you recipe ideas for food that is about to go bad. It can also tell you not to buy something you always let go bad or buy less of it.

## Phase I: User Inquiry and Inspection

* **Research Method:** Google Forms survey shared with the class via the CSCI 431 Slack. The participants were our classmates from the class. Once the data was gathered, Charles collected screenshots of the data in the form of pie and bar graphs.

* According to the results of the survey, while participants don’t really have as big of an issue with food waste as we thought, we did find that lack of preparedness when grocery shopping is an issue our classmates face.

## Phase II: User-Centered Design

* While our data showed that users’ food doesn’t tend to go bad and that being unprepared was an issue our classmates faced when going grocery shopping, it’s important to keep in mind that our sample size was incredibly small. However, there were still individuals in our survey that dealt with food waste and weren’t sure about how to keep groceries fresh. Our app aims to help users make the best out of their groceries by showing them what will soon go bad and how to cook or prepare those ingredients.

* Our persona and scenario showed us that there can be situations in which being prepared doesn’t solve everything. There may be products not on your **Shopping List** that make it into your cart. We considered this a completely normal occurrence so we thought this could be solved by creating a feature where a user can scan their receipt with their phone’s camera. Anything not on their **Shopping List** would be added to their **Fridge/Freezer/Pantry**.

## Phase III: Usability Evaluation
Usability evaluation has proceeded for 40 minutes and our prototype is provided to a tester. We asked several questions before we started the test. Then, we gave four tasks to analyze the usability of our prototype. Each task contained a different mission, which required to use a new part of the prototype. While the evaluation proceeded, one moderator asked questions and two note-takers wrote down how the test reacted.

* Formative approach - We used this approach because it best suited our circumstances. This approach and particular situation would mean getting our participant and professor to use our app and point out any major flaws. The goal is to find some of the more prominent usability issues with out app so that we can fix them.

* Think aloud protocol - Our protocol required our participant to describe what they were looking at, what they liked and didn't like about the app, and what surprised them or confused them. This would give us a clearer view into one of our users' perspectives.
* Summary of the evaluation
  * Task 1 - The tester liked the categorized storage and photos matched with food items. However, the tester felt inconvenience since our shopping list didn’t indicate the amount when the tester added an item. 
  * Task 2 - The tester was confused about adding food item restrictions and lost the way to proceed the task.
  * Task 3 - The tester knew that a red balloon on the top right of the food image was a warning sign, but didn’t know the exact meaning of the abbreviation.
  * Task 4 - Instead of the word ‘inbox’, a new word ‘notification’ seemed to be more suitable for the tester.
