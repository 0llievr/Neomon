#### Explination of tasks
##### Task one
  The purpose of task one is to test the usability of the refirgerator and list app. By having the user go thorough a standard check and add we can see how they use the app in a general usage case. 
  
##### Task two
  The purpose of task two is to test the filter functionality of the recipy tab. We want to see how the user interacts with the filter options to dertermine if it is an optimal layout.
  
##### Task three
  The purpose of task three is to dertermine what the best way to notify the user about food going bad is. There are two places where the user can find this information and we want to see which is the most easily found and used.
  
##### Task four
  Task four higlights the statistics of the user after using the app for a little while. We want to see if the user would actually gain any insight by knowing what they are using and not using in terms of food items.

__Formative approach__ - We used this approach because it best suited our circumstances. This approach and particular situation would mean getting our participant and professor to use our app and point out any major flaws. The goal is to find some of the more prominent usability issues with out app so that we can fix them.

__Think aloud protocol__ - Our protocol required our participant to describe what they were looking at, what they liked and didn't like about the app, and what surprised them or confused them. This would give us a clearer view into one of our users' perspectives.
