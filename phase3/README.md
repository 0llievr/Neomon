## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

### Introduction:
(Following informed consent...) Thank you for agreeing to participate. For the next few minutes, we will be looking at an app to gain insight into how you would use it and how to make it easier to use. Keep in mind though, that this is not a test of you, we are evaluating the apps usability. Your ability or inability to use the app will purely be a reflection of its own design.
We will be video recording this interview for note-taking purposes so we can go back and review it in case we missed anything. At the end of the study, we will delete the recording. Your name and any other personal information will not be included in the notes and will be kept strictly confidential.
While you use the app, I would like you to “think out loud” and let me know what you are doing and thinking – what you like and dislike, what surprises or confuses you, and any other thoughts you have.    
Do you have any questions before we begin?
Background:
Firstly we need to ask a few questions to identify what type of user you are.

  1) Do you use a grocery list when you go shopping?




  2) What are the common food items you let spoil?





  3) What percentage of your food do you spoil?


  4) What features would you expect in an all-in-one grocery app?





## Task 1
Your mom sends you an email with a family recipe for vegetarian stuffed bell pepper you really want to make. You need to add the items manually to your shopping list so you don't forget any items or buy the wrong items for the recipe. You just got back into town so your fridge is pretty empty but you might have some items already. Walk us through how you would check to see if you have Bell peper, minced garlic, green onion and vegetarian meat crumbles and add missing items to your grocery list without getting up off the couch.




  On a scale of 1-5 where 1 is “very difficult” and 5 is “very easy” how would you rate this experience? why?



  What could be improved upon? Why?




## Task 2
You are having 3 of your friends who are picky eaters over for lunch. You want to make sure that you dont cook anything that would break any of their dietary restrictions or include food that they dont like. Using the app find a vegetarian recipe that doesn't contain dairy. Then add all the items to the grocery list.

### Wrap up
Now that your time with the prototype is done, i want to ask a few questions about your overall impressions of it. What did you most like?



Most dislike?




Any additional features or pathways you would like to see implemented in future versions of the app?
