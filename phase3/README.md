#### Explination of tasks
* __Task one__
    * The purpose of task one is to test the usability of the refrigerator and the shopping list sections. By having the user go through a standard check and add, we can see how they use the app in a general usage case.
    * The tester tried to click a plus button in the fridge section to add items in the shopping list, but actually it was for adding an item in the refrigerator. The tester liked the categorized storage and photos matched with food items. However, the tester felt inconvenience since our shopping list didn’t indicate the amount when the tester added an item. 
    * The tester responded that it was the easy task and the task took 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
  
* __Task two__
    * The purpose of task two is to test the filter functionality of the recipe tab. We wanted to see how the user interacts with the filter options to determine if it is an optimal layout.
    * The tester was confused about adding food item restrictions and lost the way to proceed with the task. The tester tried to find an appropriate recipe using the filter a couple of times after the first trial. Unfortunately, the tester gave up to do the task since our prototype was not perfect.
    * The tester responded that it was a normal task and the task took 4 minutes.
  
* __Task three__
    * The purpose of task three is to determine what the best way to notify the user about food going bad is. There are two places where the user can find this information and we want to see which is the most easily found and used.
    * The tester knew that a red balloon on the top right of the food image was a warning sign, but didn’t know the exact meaning of the abbreviation.
    * The tester responded that it was a normal task and the task took 1 minute.
  
* __Task four__
    * Task four highlights the statistics of the user after using the app for a little while. We wanted to see if the user would actually gain any insight by knowing what they are using and not using in terms of food items.
    * Instead of the word ‘inbox’, a new word ‘notification’ seemed to be more suitable for the tester.
    * The tester responded that it was a normal task and the task took 1 minute.

__Formative approach__ - We used this approach because it best suited our circumstances. This approach and particular situation would mean getting our participant and professor to use our app and point out any major flaws. The goal is to find some of the more prominent usability issues without app so that we can fix them.

__Think aloud protocol__ - Our protocol required our participant to describe what they were looking at, what they liked and didn't like about the app, and what surprised them or confused them. This would give us a clearer view of one of our users' perspectives.
